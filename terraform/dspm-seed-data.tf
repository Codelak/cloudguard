# Uploads one object into the legacy_exports bucket containing
# sensitive-SHAPED data for DSPM discovery, built entirely from
# industry-standard, safe, non-functional test values:
#   - Visa's own published test card number (4111111111111111),
#     recognized worldwide as non-functional test data
#   - An SSA-documented never-issued SSN pattern (area number 900,
#     which the Social Security Administration has never assigned)
#   - AWS's own published example access key
#     (AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE), already used the same way in DocuTrust
# None of this is real, sensitive, or functional. It is shaped to be
# FOUND by a classifier, not to BE anything real.
